## Introduction

This report documents the design and implementation of a 2-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using basic logic gates. The ALU is a critical component of the CPU, responsible for executing arithmetic and logical operations. Our implementation focuses on a simplified 2-bit version that demonstrates the fundamental concepts of ALU design.

### Project Objectives

- To design a basic 2-bit ALU capable of performing simple arithmetic and logical operations
- To implement the ALU using discrete logic gate ICs
- To develop a software simulator that validates our hardware design
- To understand the internal hardware workings of an ALU

## Theoretical Background

### What is an ALU?

The Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) is a digital circuit that performs arithmetic and bitwise operations on binary numbers. It is a fundamental building block of the central processing unit (CPU) of a computer. Modern CPUs contain very complex ALUs capable of performing many operations. Our 2-bit ALU is a simplified version that demonstrates the basic principles.

### Operations Implemented

Our ALU implements six fundamental operations:

1. **Bitwise AND**: Performs a logical AND on each pair of corresponding bits
2. **Bitwise OR**: Performs a logical OR on each pair of corresponding bits
3. **Bitwise XOR**: Performs a logical XOR on each pair of corresponding bits
4. **Addition**: Adds two 2-bit numbers with carry
5. **Subtraction**: Subtracts using 2's complement method
6. **NOT**: Performs a logical NOT (1's complement) on the input

### Binary Representation and 2's Complement

For our 2-bit ALU, numbers are represented using only 2 bits, allowing values from 0 to 3:
- 00: 0
- 01: 1
- 10: 2
- 11: 3

For subtraction, we use the 2's complement method:
1. Invert all bits (1's complement)
2. Add 1 to the result

For a 2-bit number, the 2's complement is:
- 2's complement of 0 (00) is 0 (00)
- 2's complement of 1 (01) is 3 (11)
- 2's complement of 2 (10) is 2 (10)
- 2's complement of 3 (11) is 1 (01)

## Design Methodology

### System Architecture

Our ALU design follows a standard architecture with:
- Input registers for the two 2-bit operands (A and B)
- Operation selector (3-bit control signal)
- Logic for each operation
- Output register for the 2-bit result
- Carry/borrow flag

### Block Diagram

The high-level block diagram of our ALU is as follows:

2. **OR Operation**: Direct implementation using OR gates
3. **XOR Operation**: Direct implementation using XOR gates
4. **Addition**: Implementation using half and full adders
5. **Subtraction**: Implementation using 2's complement and adders
6. **NOT Operation**: Direct implementation using NOT gates

### Software Simulation

To validate our hardware design and provide a learning tool, we developed two software components:

#### Command-Line Simulator

A Python-based simulator that demonstrates all ALU operations with various input combinations. The simulator provides a comprehensive test of all possible input combinations and verifies the expected outputs.

```python
# Example code from our simulator showing the AND operation
def alu_and(a, b):
    result = [0, 0]
    result[0] = a[0] & b[0]
    result[1] = a[1] & b[1]
    return result
<pre style="font-family: monospace; white-space: pre;">

#### GUI Visualizer

A graphical interface that shows:
- Interactive inputs and outputs
- Visual representation of the circuit for each operation
- Real-time updates as inputs change

Our visualizer uses Tkinter for the UI and provides:
- Toggle switches for inputs
- LED representations for outputs
- Dynamic circuit diagram that updates based on selected operation

## Testing and Validation

### Test Methodology

We tested our ALU implementation using:
1. **Exhaustive testing**: Testing all possible input combinations (16 combinations for each operation)
2. **Edge cases**: Special focus on carry and borrow conditions
3. **Software validation**: Comparing hardware results with software simulation

## Results Analysis

### Performance Evaluation

Our ALU performs as expected with the following characteristics:

1. **Propagation Delay**:
   - Measured maximum propagation delay: ~20ns
   - Longest delay path: Subtraction operation (involves multiple gate stages)

2. **Power Consumption**:
   - Measured current draw: ~25mA at 5V
   - Power consumption: ~125mW

3. **Fan-out Capabilities**:
   - Each gate can reliably drive up to 10 standard TTL inputs
   - LED outputs required buffering with resistors to prevent excessive current draw

### Comparison with Expected Results

All operations performed correctly according to our design specifications. The hardware implementation matched the software simulation with 100% accuracy.

We identified some timing considerations during testing:
- When rapidly switching between operations, brief transitional states were observed
- Adding small capacitors (47pF) at key points helped stabilize the outputs during transitions

## Challenges and Solutions

### Technical Challenges

1. **Challenge**: Signal integrity issues on the breadboard
   **Solution**: Added decoupling capacitors near ICs and kept wire lengths short

2. **Challenge**: Input switch bouncing causing erratic behavior
   **Solution**: Implemented simple RC debounce circuits for each switch

3. **Challenge**: Multiplexer complexity for operation selection
   **Solution**: Designed a simplified multiplexer using just AND and OR gates instead of a dedicated multiplexer IC

4. **Challenge**: Ensuring consistent power delivery across all ICs
   **Solution**: Used separate power and ground lines for critical components and added extra capacitors

### Design Tradeoffs

1. **Simplicity vs. Functionality**:
   - We chose to implement fewer operations (6) to keep the circuit complexity manageable
   - This tradeoff made the design more accessible for educational purposes

2. **Component Selection**:
   - Using discrete 7400 series ICs increased physical size but improved understanding
   - Modern alternatives like PALs or FPGA would be more efficient but less educational

3. **Power Considerations**:
   - TTL logic has higher power consumption than CMOS alternatives
   - We accepted this tradeoff for better compatibility with breadboard prototyping

## Conclusion

We successfully designed and implemented a functional 2-bit ALU that:
- Performs six basic operations (AND, OR, XOR, ADD, SUB, NOT)
- Demonstrates the fundamental concepts of ALU design
- Provides visual feedback through LED outputs

### Future Improvements

Potential enhancements for future versions:
- Expanding to 4-bit or 8-bit operations

- Implementing a complete instruction set
- Creating a PCB version of the circuit
- Adding display decoders for decimal output
- Integrating with a program counter and memory to create a simple CPU
